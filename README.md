# Foxes and rabbits

Project: foxes-and-rabbits-v1.

Authors: Michael Kölling and David J. Barnes

This project is part of the material for chapter 10 of the book:

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ.
   Sixth edition.
   David J. Barnes and Michael Kölling.
   Pearson Education, 2016

A predator-prey simulation involving foxes and rabbits in
an enclosed rectangular field.

This is the first version of the simulation. This version
does not use inheritance.

## How to start:
Create a Simulator object.
Then call one of:
+ simulateOneStep - for a single step.
+ simulate - and supply a number (say 10) for that many steps.
+ runLongSimulation - for a simulation of 500 steps.
